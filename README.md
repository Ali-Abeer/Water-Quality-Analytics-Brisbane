# Water-Quality-Analytics-Brisbane
This project analyzes real-world water-quality parameters (Temperature, pH, Conductivity, DO Oxygen, Salinity, Turbidity, etc.) and presents insights through a multi-page Power BI dashboard. The dashboard allows environmental analysts to explore trends, anomalies, seasonal patterns, parameter variance, and daily drill-downs for individual sample days.

**Key Features**

Total samples & readings KPIs
Avg / Min / Max / Std-Dev monitoring
Monthly & rolling 7-day trend detection
Parameter-aware filtering
Seasonality analysis by month
Variance from long-term historical average
Drill-through "sample insight" page for individual dates
Quality control checks that flag abnormal readings

**Data Model**

Fact-water-quality table
Date dimension
Parameter dimension
Star-schema with clean relational structure


**Tools & Technologies**

Power BI
Power Query
DAX
CSV sensor data


**Key DAX Measures**

**Conclusions**

This dashboard reveals:
Seasonal climate effects
Parameter stability vs volatility
Short-term vs long-term deviations
Sensor anomaly detection
High-value water-quality insights for operations & science teams

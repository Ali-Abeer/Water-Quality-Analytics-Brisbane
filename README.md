# Water-Quality-Analytics-Brisbane
This project analyzes real-world water-quality parameters (Temperature, pH, Conductivity, DO Oxygen, Salinity, Turbidity, etc.) and presents insights through a multi-page Power BI dashboard. The dashboard allows environmental analysts to explore trends, anomalies, seasonal patterns, parameter variance, and daily drill-downs for individual sample days.
